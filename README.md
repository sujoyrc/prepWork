This is the code for a simple sparse coding based speech enhancement in the presence of unstructured interferer and no user specific dictionaries.

This is in lines with SPEECH ENHANCEMENT WITH SPARSE CODING IN LEARNED DICTIONARIES 

Sigg, Christian D., Tomas Dikk, and Joachim M. Buhmann. "Speech enhancement with sparse coding in learned dictionaries." Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2010 IEEE International Conference on. IEEE, 2010.

Also Sigg, Christian D., Tomas Dikk, and Joachim M. Buhmann. "Speech enhancement using generative dictionary learning." IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing 20.6 (2012): 1698-1712. - though LARC is not implemented.

Input:-
Single speaker speech signals corrupted by noise. Files in .wav file
For the current process I have processed 30 files however code is usable for any number of files
